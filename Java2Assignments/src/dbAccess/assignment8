Fall Semester 2014


Assignment 1: 
	Build a simple class called DBTester.java. This class should have only one 
	method, main method.  In the main method you should read in all of the rows 
	of data from the Instructors Table in the Registration Database, then print 
	out this data.  Follow the steps outlined in class.  Remember to use 
	try-catch blocks for all database access code.  The example in the book does
	not use Try-catch blocks, but you should.
