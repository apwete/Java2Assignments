LAB #9 – 30 Points
DB Access
Fall  Semester 2014

 In this lab, you will be working with Business Objects and DBs. 

1.)	Create a class called Student.  This class will not be tied to the Database, 
yet.  The Student class should have the same properties as the Database table:  
SID, FirstName, LastName, etc.   Include all the set and get functions as 
needed.  Include 2 constructors, an empty constructor, and one that takes all 
properties. Include a display() method that prints out all properties. Use a 
main to instantiate and test out this Student class. (Hint: No database calls in
this class, yet.)

Testing Code in Main() method →

Student  s = new Student(4,”Frank”, “Jones”, “123 Main”, “Atlanta”, “GA”, 30133, 
“fj@yahoo.com”, 3.2);

s.display();


2.)	Modify 1.) from above.  Add a new Method called selectDB() that takes only 
one argument, SID.  When a user calls this method, it should SELECT from the 
database that Student and get all the Student’s data from the database, and put 
this data into the appropriate properties.  (Hint: You will use an SQL Select 
statement here.)  Test out this method in the main. 

Testing Code in Main() method →

Student  s1 = new Student();  
s1.selectDB(4);     //accessing DB
s1.display();          //displays all data from DB for student with id=4

3.)	Modify 2.) from above.  This time we are add another method called 
insertDB().  This method will take all 9 data elements as arguments.  This 
method will then Insert this information into the Student table, as well as 
fill up the object with the data provided.  (Hint: You will use an SQL Insert 
statement here.)   
  
Testing Code in Main() method →

Student s2=new Student();

s2.insertDB(33, “Frank”, “Mayes”, “123 Main street”, “Atlanta”, “GA”, 30100, 
"fmayes@yahoo.com”,3.3f);

s2.display();

4.)	Lastly add 2 functions to Update and Delete student information.

Testing Code in Main() method →

Student s3 = new Student();
s3.find(6);
s3.deleteDB();
And
Student s4 = new Student ();
s4.find(7);
s4.setZipcode(30106);
s4.updateDB();
