RMI – 30 Points
Fall Semester 2014
 
 

 In this lab, you will be working with RMI.

Go through all of the STEPS necessary to implement the simple RMI Message 
program we discussed in class.






Using RMI in Java
Steps:

1.)	Open an Editor, like NotePad++, and type in the the 3 parts of the Simple 
RMI Project; → the Message Interface, the ServerMessage and the ClientMessage.  

2.)	Open 2 DOS Windows on your PC (One window is for the Server and one window 
is for the Client)

	a.	In the Server Window, do the following:
		•	Compile the Message.java file.
		•	Compile the ServerMessage.java file.
		•	Type: “start rmiregistry” (This starts the rmiregistry in a new DOS 
			Window.)
		•	Type: “rmic ServerMessage” (This creates the ‘stub’ file that is 
			needed to communicate to the Client.)
		•	Run the ServerMessage class, type :    “java ServerMessage”

	b.	In the Client Window, do the following:
		•	Compile the ClientMessage file.
		•	Run the ClientMessage java class, type: “java ClientMessage”.

3.)	To run the Client on a separate machine do the following → 

	a.	Copy the following 3 files to the second machine:  Message.class, and 
		the MessageServer_stub.class and the ClientMessage.java.  
	b.	Open a DOS Window on the Second machine.
	c.	Edit the ClientMessage.java file, change ‘localhost’ to the name of the 
		machine where the Server is.
	d.	Compile the ClientMessage.java file.
	e.	Run the ClientMessage java class, type: “java ClientMessage”.
