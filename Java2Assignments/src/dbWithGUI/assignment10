Java Programming II
LAB #10
Student Class & GUI – 30 Points
Fall Semester 2014
 
 
 In this lab, you will be working with Business Objects and GUIs.


A.)	Recall the Student class that you built in Lab #9(Student.java).   You will 
be using this class to access the Database.  Also recall the StudentGUI class 
that you built in Lab #2(StudentGUI.java).

B.)	Your task for this lab is to make a student’s data(name, email, gpa) show up 
in the StudentGUI.  
C.)	The user will run the StudentGUI class, and the GUI will show up.  The User 
will then enter a student ID number in the ID textfield and click the Find 
button.  Your event code will read the ID number the user entered, use that ID 
number and the Student Business Object to retrieve that one student’s data from 
the DB(selectDB()).  Lastly, pull out the individual data elements 
(i.e firstName) from the Student Business Object and put them into the 
appropriate textfields in the StudentGUI.


Also make the “Insert”, “Delete” and “Update” buttons work. Have fun.
