Handling Exceptions
Fall Semester 2014

1.) Build a class called “TestExceptions.java”.  Put the following code in the main 
method.

int myArr = new int[10];
int x,y,z;
x=0;
y=10;
z=y/x;

myArr[10] = 0;

	What happens?
	Now add try/catch blocks to catch these exceptions?
	Is there another way that you can prevent a run-time error without
		Using try-catch blocks?


2.) Next build an Account class.  The Account class should have 3 Properties: Balance, 
Owner and AcctNo.  The Account class should have 2 constructors, one that takes all 3 
properties and one that takes no args(the default).   The Account class should have set
and get methods as well as deposit and withdraw methods.  Also include a display() 
method that outputs AcctNo, Owner and Balance. Use a main() method to test out this 
class. 

Use the following code, in the main method, to test the Account class?
Account a1;
a1 = new Account(2222, “Frank”, 1000);
a1.deposit(100.00);
a1.display();



3.) Now in your Account main() method, attempt to withdraw more than the current 
balance that is available.  What happens now?

Use the following code to test the Account class?
Account a1;
a1 = new Account(2222, “Frank”, 500);
a1.deposit(100.00);
a1.withdraw(900.00);
a1.display();

	We will fix this problem in Lab #4.
