LAB #7 – (30 Points)
Threads
Fall Semester 2014

 In this lab, you will be working with Threads.  


1. Write an Application that extends the Thread class, call it MyThread.java.  Have your 
new class accept an integer(i.e. 200) when it is instantiated. (MyThread mt = new 
MyThread(200); )This integer number will be the number of times that this class loops and 
prints a message.  The message should read  “Thread Running…200”. The 200 would be 
whatever number is passed into the constructor.  If the number was 300, then the output 
should read “ Thread Running ….. 300”.  Use a main method to test this class.  In the main
start 2 Threads, one Thread with 250 and one Thread with 300.  What happens?  You do not 
need to use the sleep() method for this exercise.



2. Modify 1.) from above.  Change this class to use the Runnable Interface instead of the 
Thread class.  Any difference how the code runs?



3. Lastly, have the main method start 4 different threads, all with different loop counts.  
Test the application, what happens?
