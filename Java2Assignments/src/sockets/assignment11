LAB #11 â€“ 30 points
Sockets
Fall Semester 2014


 In this lab, you will be working with Sockets.


1.)	Sending a String:  Build 2 classes,  one A Server(ServerString.java) that 
sends a single String message and the second, a Client(ClientString.java) that 
receives the message and prints it to the Console.  No GUI programming is needed.
Have these 2 classes work in separate DOS windows. You will need 2 DOS Windows 
to test these classes out.  Run the Server first in one DOS Window, then run the 
Client in the Second DOS Window.  At first, run the 2 classes on the same 
machine.  After you get them working on one machine, you may want to try to run 
the classes on 2 different machines.

2.)	Sending Integers:  Build 2 classes,  one A Client(ClientInt.java) that sends 
say 5 integers;  the second, a Server(ServerInt.java) that receives the integers 
and prints them to the Console.  The Server should continue to read data from 
the Client until it reads a 0(zero) from the Client.  Have these 2 classes work 
in DOS windows. You will need 2 DOS Windows to test these classes out.  Run the 
Server first in one DOS Window, then run the Client in the Second DOS Window.  
At first, run the 2 classes on the same machine.  After you get them working on 
one machine, you may want to try to run the classes on 2 different machines.
