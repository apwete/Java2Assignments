CIST 2372
Java Programming II
LAB #1 (30 Points)
Swing GUIs
Fall Semester 2014


In this lab, you will be working with SWING Components to build Simple GUIs. 

REQUIRED:
1.) Create a simple SWING Form to Display Student Data.  The top part of the
form should say “Student Information”.  The middle part of the form will contain
labels and textFields; one each for ID, FirstName, LastName, Email and GPA.  The
bottom part should have 5 Buttons that read “Find”, “Insert”, “Delete”, “Update”
and “Exit”.

2.) Add a few neat SWING features, like tooltips, borders, colors, etc.  Also the
Exit button should work and the “X” at the top right of the Window should also
close the Application.  Make it so that when the User clicks on the Exit Button, a
MessageBox Window popup and ask the User if they are sure that they want to exit. 
If they say “Yes”, then Exit the App.  We learned about events last Semester.

 topPanel  extend JPanel
	Label = "Student Information"
	
 middlePanel  extend JPanel
	Label/TextFields
		ID
		fName

		email
		gpa
	GridLayout
	
 bottomPanel  extend JPanel
