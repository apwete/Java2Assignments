Writing to Files
Fall Semester 2014


1.) File Details – Build a class called FileDetails.java.  When you instantiate this class and 
	give it a filename, it will report back the size of the file, whether the file is Readable 
	and whether the file is Writeable; plus any other file information that you might deem 
	important. 

	This cd goes in main 
	
	FileDetails fd=newFileDetails(“anyfile.doc”); 
	
	All other code goes in the constructor.


2.) Writing to a File – This time build a FileWrite.java.  This class, when instantiated, will 
	create a new file and write a String to the file. This coed goes in main 

	FileWrite fw = new FileWrite(“myfile.txt”, “Go Falcons”);   
	
	All other code goes in the constructor.


3.) Reading from a File – This time build a class called FileRead.java.  This class, when 
	instantiated, will read the text from a file and print the data to the Console.  This code 
	goes in main FileRead fr = new FileRead(“myfile.txt”); 

	All other code goes in the constructor.
